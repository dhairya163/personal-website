The free builder shines with its **content optimizer** and **ATS compatibility**. It's a solid pick if you want a free resume builder that values substance over extensive design choices.

## [Google Docs Resume Builder](https://resumegenius.com/resume-templates/google-docs-resume-templates)

### Google Docs Resume Builder Customization

Google Docs' customization options are remarkably accessible. You can easily modify fonts, colors, and spacing to match your personal brand. The platform lets you make structural changes like adjusting column widths and section arrangements. The only limitation is that columns must be equal in width, which might restrict some layout options.

A great feature is knowing how to [create different versions of your resume](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/25793719/how-to-create-different-versions-of-a-google-doc-like-when-you-want-to-personalize-a-resume?hl=en) for different job applications while keeping the original template intact.

The platform still gives great value through unlimited resume creation and downloads. The templates work well with ATS systems, which matters a lot in today's job applications.
