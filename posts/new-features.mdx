NextBlog has finally received an update, adding many features. Let's introduce them one by oneÔºÅüéâ

### Add Comments

**Comments** are finally here! You can now add comments to your blog posts.Click the `üí¨Show Comment` button at the bottom of the article to leave a comment.

comments are powered by  [Giscus](https://giscus.app) and [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/),
you can customize the comments by modifying the `blog.comment` configuration in `blog.config.ts`.

### Search

**Search** is now available! You can search for articles by entering keywords in the search box.

Experience using shortcut keys - `Ctrl + k` or `Cmd + k` to focus on the search box


### Tags

Now, NextBlog will categorize your articles by tags and integrate them into the [**Tags**](/tags) page,
and you can also click on the tags in the article to view all related articles under that tag.

It is usually recommended that you do not add too many tags to an article, as this will make your article classification clearer.

### Simplified Configuration

The configuration file `blog.config.ts` has been simplified, and you can easily customize the website by modifying the configuration file.

You may need to reconfigure to run the project!

Here is an example of a new configuration file:

```
    author: "yuanli",  // author name
    logo: {
        // you can use image or text as the logo, you can choose both, but the image will be displayed first
        image: "/logo.png", //  the file path of the logo in the public directory
        text: "NextBlog", // null || text

        // whether the logo is a link to the home page
        isHomeLink: true, // true | false
    },

    // website title
    title: "NextBlog",

    // website description
    description: "A minimalist blog created with Next.js ,Shadcn-ui and Tailwind.css",

    // light | dark
    theme: "light",

    // your blog repo || your github repo || null
    githubRepo: "https://github.com/imyuanli/next-blog",

    // routes
    routes: [...],

    // home page config
    home: {
        title: "Welcome to NextBlog",
        description: "A minimalist blog created with Next.js ,Shadcn-ui and Tailwind.css",

        // introduction or about me
        intro: Intro, // file path of the introduction

        socials: {...},
    },

    // blog page config
    blog: {
        title: 'My Blog',
        description: 'All of my long-fesign, and more, collected in chronological order.',
        comment: {
            enabled: true,
            engine: "giscus", // giscus | utterances
            // giscus doc: https://giscus.app
            giscus: {...},

            // utterances doc: https://utteranc.es
            utterances: {...}
        },
    },

    // tags page config
    tags: {
        title: 'Tags',
        description: 'All of my tags, collected in alphabetical order.',
    },

    // project page config
    project: {
        title: "Look what I've done",
        description: "Some small tools made by oneself",

        // status color and text
        getStatus: (status: string) => {...},

        // name, description, href are required
        // github: username/repo
        // status: getStatus return value
        // and so on
        // you can add more fields according to your needs ,but you need to modify the code in the project/page.tsx file
        projects: [...],
    },

    // search config
    search: {
        enabled: true,
        engine: "cmdk", //  cmdk | algolia
    },

    // footer config
    footer: {
        isShow: true,
        // whether to display the "Powered by NextBlog" in the footerÔºåyou can set it to falseÔºåbut I hope you can keep itÔºåthank youÔºÅ
        isShowPoweredBy: true,
    },
```
