## Pagination

The pagination feature has been added to the article list page, and the number of articles displayed on each page can be set in the configuration file.

Although I don't think the pagination feature is necessary, some people may like it, so I added this feature.

``` javascript
    blog: {
        ...
        comment: {...},
        pagination: {
            enabled: true,
            pageSize: 5,
            engine: "default", // default:pagination button | loadMore:loading more button
        }
    },
```


## Table of contents

> This function is temporarily uncontrollable, and the display is fixed on the right side of the page.

NextBlog will collect titles from articles and generate a table of contents for readers to quickly locate a specific part of the article.

And we will also adjust the title ranking accordingly to ensure that there is only one top-level title in the document.

It is worth mentioning that top-level titles will not appear in the directory

Check the table of contents on the right side of the article and experience it


## Pinned articles

Adding the 'pinned' field to YAML Front Matter in the article will fix the article at the top of the article list.

The articles that are placed at the top will not be sorted by publication date, but will be sorted based on the value of the 'pinned' field you set.
The smaller the value, the higher the ranking of the article.

```yaml
    title: ...
    summary: ...
    date: ...
    tags: ...
    pinned: 1 // 2,3,4...
```

The current article is a pinned article

## Timed release

In this version, the feature of timed release of articles is supported

you only need to set the `date` field in the article to a future time to achieve the function of timed release of articles.

```yaml
title: ....
summary: ...
date: 2024-08-01
tags: ...
draft: ...
```


## Remark and Rehype

> The plugin currently does not support customization

Thank you very much for the plugins provided by Remark and Rehope, which make the article more beautiful and more readable.

NextBlog has integrated the following plugins:

- remark-slug
- remark-autolink-headings
- remark-gfm
- remark-flexible-toc
- remark-normalize-headings
- rehype-highlight
- rehype-shiki

We will continue to add more plugins in the future to make the article more beautiful and practical.


## Side toolbar

> This function is temporarily uncontrollable, and the display is fixed on the left side of the page.

This feature is still in its early stages and can only return to the previous page and scroll to comments.


## Back to top

> This function is temporarily uncontrollable, and the display is fixed on the right side of the page.

Now you can easily return to the top with just one click, without the need to slowly slide to the top anymore!


## Final words

I have made some adjustments to the design and functionality of the page, and I hope everyone will enjoy this update.
If you have any suggestions or ideas, please feel free to leave a comment in the comments section and I will reply to you as soon as possible.
Finally, thank you all for your support of NextBlog. I will continue to work hard to provide a better experience for everyone.

Thank you for your support! üôè
