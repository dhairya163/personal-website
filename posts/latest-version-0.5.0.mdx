Hey folks! 🎉 I’ve made some exciting updates and tweaks to enhance your blogging experience.
This update is a breaking change, so please read the documentation carefully.
We’ve made some significant changes to the configuration and added new features to make your blog even better. 🚀

> It is worth mentioning that the article you are seeing is a scheduled article.It was uploaded on 2024-09-13, but will be published on 2024-09-14.

## Features ✨

### Config Simplification

I have made adjustments to the level and structure of the blog configuration file.
If your blog is based on the previous version, you may need to reconfigure it.
For details, please refer to the `blog.config.ts` file.

The changes to the configuration file mainly divide the configuration file into two parts, one is the basic blog configuration, and the other is the plugin configuration.

This is to prepare for future plug-in development and make the configuration file clearer.

### Vercel Analytics

I’ve integrated Vercel Analytics to help you gain insights into your blog's performance.
This addition will help you track your audience better and optimize accordingly. 📈

Currently, I only support Vercel Analytics.This feature is enabled by default in your blog, but you need to enable Analytics in the project on vercel.com.
For details, can be found in the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics).
If you don't want to use this feature, you can disable it in the `blog.config.ts` file.

### New Newsletter Feature

Yes, I’ve introduced a brand new newsletter feature! Sign up and never miss an update.
You’ll now find a shiny new newsletter section in the footer and right next to the blog title. Stay updated with ease! 📰

I've made configurations as flexible as possible so you can adjust them to suit your needs.
Please refer to the `newsletter` plugin configuration in the `blog.config.ts` file for specific configuration.

Currently only [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) is supported.
If you want to use this feature, you need to register an account on Buttondown.

### Pagination Plugin

I’ve split the pagination functionality into its own plugin! This should make things a lot cleaner and easier to manage.

The pagination plugin is enabled by default, and you can configure the plugin in the `blog.config.ts` file.

### Article top order

I've added a new configuration item `pinnedSort` in the `blog.config.ts` file.
You can set the order of the pinned articles at the top of the article list.

It has two values:
 - desc：The larger the value, the higher the article ranking. This is the default value.
 - asc：The smaller the value, the higher the article ranking


## Bug Fixes 🛠️

- **Future Posts Bug**: Fixed the pesky bug that was preventing future dated posts from showing up. They’re back! 🎉
- **Pagination Error**: Resolved the issue with pagination for all articles in a category. Now you can browse without any hiccups.
- **Comment Toggle**: I’ve removed the manual toggle for comments. Let’s keep it simple!

### Final Thoughts

These changes are all about making your blogging experience smoother and more enjoyable. I truly hope you find these updates beneficial.
